# 🐱🐭 Cat and Mouse Simulator: Minimax Strategy

This project is a simulation of a cat and mouse chase, where the cat's objective is to catch the mouse, and the mouse's goal is to survive as long as possible. The simulation employs the Minimax algorithm to model intelligent behavior for both characters.

- **Cat**: Uses Minimax strategy to minimize the distance to the mouse.
- **Mouse**: Uses Minimax strategy to maximize the distance from the cat and avoid being caught.

## Features:

- Grid-based simulation environment.
- Mute button for toggling background music.
- Visual representation of the cat and mouse.
- Restart functionality to run multiple simulations.
- Count functionality to track the number of rounds won by the cat and the mouse.
